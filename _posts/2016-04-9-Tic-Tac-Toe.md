A riveting tic-tac-toe game written in HTML, Javascript, jQuery and CSS animation.

I used a magic square and JavaScript to check for a winner on each play. A magic square is an arrangement of numbers, with each number occurring exactly once and the sum of the entries of any row, column, or  diagonal is the same.  

CSS animation was used to create a simple falling confetti reaction once a player wins.
