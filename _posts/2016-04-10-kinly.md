Kinly is an IoT based web application designed to promote family interaction and reduce the negative impact of social isolation among seniors. Kinly won multiple awards at the Hacking Health Hamilton event where we built our prototype over an intense 36 hour period.

Awards include the title prize from "Cossette Health Award" featuring incubation, resources, programming and marketing/communications provided by Cossette Health and the "Best Business Model Award" featuring technical and business advisory services from Mohawk MEDIC.

Kinly was built using Agile Methodologies. We split up an entire weekend's worth of work into short 2 hour sprints followed by 5 minute stand-ups. This development technique allowed us maximum flexibility leading to several key pivots ultimately producing a functional prototype demonstrated live & in the cloud on stage. We are very proud to have made over 150 git commits during the course of the event in addition to completing a lot of design work, research, business model canvas and more.

Technologies: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript / jQuery, Raspberry Pi 2, AWS, Linux, Agile OOP, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, git & more.
